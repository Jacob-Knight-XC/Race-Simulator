#Cross Country Race Simulator

This is a cross country race simulator that takes data from TFRRS and allows you
to simulate a simple team or individual race. 

What you need?
    If you were to run the scraper you need to pip install scrapy then in the same level 
    as the scrapy.cfg file you can input scrapy crawl xc(the name of the spider) into the terminal
    and it will run. It takes 20-30 min to run. You shouldn't need to run this except during cross 
    country season if you want the most recent races. 

    You also would need to pip install streamlit as my streamlit app is not live yet. I don't
    plan to publish it until I have more finished on this project. To run the UI you must be in 
    the User_interface level and input streamlit run UI.py(the source file for UI) in your terminal. 
    The app will then automatically open in your browser.
